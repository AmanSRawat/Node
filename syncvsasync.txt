In the sync we have to first serve the first user first it is like fcfs 
and thus first user can take more time so there will be the starvation among the users

Whereas in the async if any user user is perdorming writng or reading task 
simultaneously we can take the task of the users and thus reduces the starvation among the users

sync is blocking, meaning tasks are performed one at a time, while async is non-blocking, meaning tasks can be performed in parallel.
